# Arun Valley Line

## Route

The Arun Valley Line is the direct route between Three Bridges on the Brighton Main Line and Arundel Jn on the West Coastway Line. The line was eventually completed in 1863, and electrified using third rail in 1938. The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway operated services along the route between London and Portsmouth, originally using the "Portsmouth Line" from Horsham to Dorking to reach London. In 1978 these were rerouted via Crawley and Three Bridges due to the increased demand for services at Gatwick Airport.

## Simulation

A timetable representing Wednesday 4th February 2026 has been included, starting at 03:45 and running until the final service at roughly 01:30. Most Southern services through Horsham split or join, and several engineering trains are thrown in for variety.

The standard off peak service pattern is as follows:

- 2tph London Victoria to Portsmouth Harbour / Bognor Regis (split at Horsham) (SN)
- 1tph London Victoria to Horsham (SN)
- 2tph Peterborough to Horsham (TL)

*Please note: This timetable requires v2.23.0 or later of RailOS to run, as it uses the Minimum Dwell Times feature.*

## Operational Tips

- Platforms for Horsham are given in the train description - it's advised to stick to these as some routes can only be accessed from specific platforms.
- Keep an eye on the level crossings - trains can sneak up on these quickly!
- Be careful not to set routes too early, especially around the sidings outside of Horsham as these can block other services.
- Trains arriving from Crawley into P4 at Horsham should use the bottom line avoiding the main junction. The points may have to be set manually for this as the route will default to setting across the junction, blocking access to P3.
